 * The old XmlAble interface enforced an setStateFromXmlMethod.

 * Due to several problems I decided to remove this method and leave the <i>deserialization</i>
 * in the hand of the programmer.
 * 
 * If standard methods are to be used, the programmer of an XmlAble class should used one of 
 * the following methods
 * 
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>Use a factory called createFromXml ( String xml )<br>
 * 		This is the preferred idea. An interface may not enforce static methods however...</li>
 * 	<li>Use a Constructor with a single String parameter</li>
 *  <li>Use a base constructor in combination with setStateFromXml ( String )<br>
 *  	This corresponds to the old XmlAble.</li>
 * </ol>
